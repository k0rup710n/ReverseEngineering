It was a pretty easy one to crack !

You have the possibility of either patch the executable or find the password manually.

Patching Executable :

if the stringCompare function return value = 1, then it prints good job, else it print a fail message. 
So you can go at the address 0000560AA641B30F in the .text section and change ->> mov eax, 0 -> to ->> mov eax, 1. 

This will make the stringCompare function always return true. 

Now you can execute the patched binary and you can try out any password it should print a success message !

Finding Password :

The check_password function, mov one hexadecimal character per rbp-offset. 
If you decode all of these hexadecimal characters to text you should obtain the string "super_secret_password_56178". 
Let's try it out, and you can see that it works, we successfully cracked the binary.
